# rental_predictor
interactive data science project using django / postgresql / various data science libraries

The goal here is for me (Doug) to learn more python while teaching my fried Tyler some software engineering strategies
such as model view controller frameworks and testing. At the same time he'll be working on the data science models, while I
work more on the controller's and views. 

The project we've selected is to make an analysis of Airbnb rental return rates in different cities around the globe.
